**Takuma Yoneda**

I am a PhD candidate at [TTIC](https://ttic.edu/), an academic institute located on the campus of the University of Chicago.  
My research interest lies in the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing, especially in the context of robotics.

In the past, I have interned at several places including [UCL](https://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) (2018 summer) and [Preferred Networks](https://www.preferred.jp/en/) (2019 summer) which is known for [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer).

I am now at [Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab](https://ttic.edu/ripl/) working with [Bradly Stadie](https://bstadie.github.io/) and [Matthew R. Walter](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~mwalter/).

<!-- I got a Bachelor of Engineering from Toyota Technological Institute (Nagoya, Japan) and worked on Graph Embedding and Natural Language Processing with Prof. [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/makoto.miwa/) and Prof. [Yutaka Sasaki](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/yutaka.sasaki/index-e.html) at Computational Intelligence Lab. -->
