**Takuma Yoneda**

I am a PhD student at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://ttic.edu/),  
interested in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I am now at [Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab](https://ttic.edu/ripl/) working with Prof. [Matthew R. Walter](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~mwalter/).

I got a Bachelor of Engineering from Toyota Technological Institute (Nagoya, Japan) and worked on Graph Embedding and Natural Language Processing with Prof. [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/makoto.miwa/) and Prof. [Yutaka Sasaki](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/yutaka.sasaki/index-e.html) at Computational Intelligence Lab.
