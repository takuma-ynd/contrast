**Takuma Yoneda**

I am a PhD student at [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://ttic.edu/),  
interested in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning and Natural Language Processing.

I am now at [Robot Intelligence through Perception Lab](https://ttic.edu/ripl/) working with Prof. [Matthew R. Walter](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~mwalter/).

I got BSc of Engineering from Toyota Technological Institute (Japan) and worked on Graph Embedding and Natural Language Processing with Prof. [Makoto Miwa](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/makoto.miwa/) and Prof. [Yutaka Sasaki](https://www.toyota-ti.ac.jp/Lab/Denshi/COIN/people/yutaka.sasaki/index-e.html) at Computational Intelligence Lab.


# Internships
- [Preferred Networks, Inc.](https://preferred.jp/en/) (Tokyo, Japan; 2019 Summer)  
Deep Reinforcement Learning for multi-agent cooperative game with communication.

- [University College London (Machine Reading Group)](https://mr.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) (London, UK; 2018 Summer)  
[Fact-Extraction and VERification (FEVER)](http://fever.ai) task. We got the [2nd place](http://fever.ai/2018/task.html) in the competition.

- [VASILY, Inc. (now acquired by ZOZO Technologies, Inc)](https://tech.zozo.com/en/) (Tokyo, Japan; 2017 Summer)  
Learning a joint embedding space for images and descriptions for multi-modal search.

- [Yamaha Motor Corporation](https://yamaha-motor.com/) (Shizuoka, Japan; 2017 Spring)  
Improving a model to obtain better bounding box for car detection.

<!-- After that, I interned at University College London Machine Reading Group to tackle [Fact-Extraction and VERification (FEVER)](http://fever.ai/) shared-task under Prof. [Pontus Stenetorp](https://pontus.stenetorp.se/) and Prof. [Sebastian Riedel](http://www.riedelcastro.org/). -->
